        <h3>Article 1</h3>
        <P>
            As a health service model promoted by the “Healthy China 2030” plan, the integration of sports and medicine
            is
            of great
            significance to the reformation of college students’ health management. Research shows that the general low
            health
            literacy, unhealthy lifestyle, significant decline in physical fitness, high incidence of subhealth, and
            prominent
            mental health problems are common among college students in China. This article comprehensively utilizes the
            literature
            data method, logical analysis method, and questionnaire survey method to analyze the health status of
            college
            students,
            the current status of the health management of college students, and outstanding issues and to focus on
            analyzing the
            current status of students’ body shape, physical function, and physical fitness indicators. From the
            perspective
            of
            examining, reflecting, and exploring physical and medical integration, it is believed that the construction
            of
            students’
            physical health issues from the perspective of the development of the integration of sports and medicine is
            manageable
            and the interaction of medicine, health, and sports can be promoted. This article discusses the
            enlightenment of
            “sports–medicine integration” with school physical education, interprets the connotation of “sports–medicine
            integration”, and analyzes the development direction of “sports–medicine integration” and physical
            education.

        <h3>Article 2</h3>
        <p>
            With the improvement in people’s health awareness, all levels of the society are deeply aware of the
            importance
            of health. Sports and medical care are important pillars of social health, and “the integration of sports
            and
            medicine” has become a current research hotspot. Nowadays, people’s dietary structure and lifestyle have
            undergone tremendous changes, and obesity has gradually become a serious problem in the field of public
            health.
            The obesity rate of college students continues to increase, and their physical fitness has been declining
            year
            by year. Some indicators are even inferior to that of middle school students. Obesity also makes college
            students low in self-confidence and prone to anxiety, which leads to interpersonal communication disorders.
            Moreover, the health of college students is also threatened by chronic diseases, and changes in lifestyle
            have
            made cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and other diseases the “killers” that
            endanger college students; in addition, clinical medicine has little effect on such diseases. This gave
            birth to
            “physical medicine fusion” health promotion.
