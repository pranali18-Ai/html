        <h3>Organizational structure</h3>
        <p>GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a
            manager"
            (self-management).[17] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation),
            but
            the chief executive set salaries. (i.e. Individual or groups of company executive leaders decides on project
            aims and development, including funding)[18]In 2014, GitHub, Inc. added a layer of middle management in
            response
            to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, Tom
            Preston-Werner
            resigned from his position as CEO.[19]</p>
